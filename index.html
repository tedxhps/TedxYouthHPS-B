                    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-6">What is TEDx?</h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">TEDx is a global program of independently organized events licensed by TED. Each TEDx event is designed to bring people together, students, thinkers, creators, and dreamers to share ideas that spark curiosity, inspire dialogue, and build bridges of understanding within their communities. These gatherings reflect the TED spirit: a belief that powerful ideas, when shared freely, can shape a better future.

At its heart, TEDx empowers local voices. It turns schools, towns, and organizations into stages for innovation where new perspectives meet, and where one person’s story can ignite another’s imagination. Every event adds to a global conversation about what it means to live thoughtfully and act with purpose.</p>
                    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-6">Importance of Chapter 1</h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-200 mb-8">Chapter 1 marks the first step in a legacy of youth-driven innovation, dialogue, and creativity. This inaugural chapter represents a shared belief that change doesn’t wait for permission; it begins when young minds decide to speak, listen, and create together. The first chapter of any story sets the tone for what’s to come. By launching this movement, we’re laying the foundation for generations of students to carry forward,  to think deeper, question harder, and reimagine what’s possible. Chapter 1 is our start, but not our limit.</p>
                    <h2 className="text-4xl font-bold text-red-500 mb-6">Theme & The Story Behind It</h2>
                    <p className="text-gray-200">Our theme explores the intersection of creativity, resilience, and technology, and the forces that define how we navigate and shape the world ahead. It asks how human imagination and innovation can coexist in a rapidly evolving digital age, and what it means to build a future that’s both connected and compassionate.

Behind this theme lies a story of balance. As the world accelerates, we look for moments that remind us of our humanity: the art, emotion, and purpose that technology alone cannot replicate. This is not just a theme for an event, but a lens through which we view our collective tomorrow.</p>

                      Boundaries exist only until someone decides to cross them. Chapter 1 of TEDxYouth@HPS|Begumpet celebrates that spirit — of curiosity, courage, and creation.

To our Board members and distinguished alumni, your presence reminds us that every limit ever crossed began with someone daring to ask “what if?”

To our speakers, thank you for lending your voices, stories, and ideas — for challenging perspectives, sparking thought, and inspiring change.

To our team and mentors, thank you for proving that passion and persistence can turn a dream into a movement.

And to our school — the place that taught us to chase, challenge and conquer — this is for you.

Here’s to breaking barriers, rewriting rules, and finding the infinite in every idea.</p>
